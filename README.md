# Deep_belief_network_KMNIST_project

This project was done as an homework for my cognition and computation class. I fine tuned a Deep Belief Network for the KMNIST dataset, performed a technique called linear readout to observe the model's internal representation at different layers and measured how much the model resists adversarial attacks compared to a simple linear model
